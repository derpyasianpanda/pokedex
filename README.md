# KV's Pokedex
This was a creative project that I made for my Web Development class (CSE 154). It is my first attempt at using public web APIs and making a web back end. My main goal for the back end was to create a simple account system and the main goal for web APIs was to efficiently grab information.

I hope you like my personal project!
